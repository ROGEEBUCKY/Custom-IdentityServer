# Identity Server with Custom UserStore 

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or a service, and Identity Server is a framework that implements the OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocols for .NET Core. In this blog post, I will explain the basics of Identity Server, how it works, and how you can use it to secure your web applications and APIs.

## What is Identity Server?

Identity Server is an open source framework that helps you to create an authentication and authorization server for your applications. It supports various scenarios, such as:

-   Single sign-on (SSO) for multiple applications and application types, such as web, mobile, desktop, and SPA.
-   User authentication via sign-in forms, social login, external identity providers, or biometric devices.
-   Service authentication via tokens, certificates, or mutual TLS.
-   User management via user stores, profile services, or identity resources.
-   Consent management via consent screens, scopes, or policies.
-   Token issuance, validation, and revocation via endpoints, validators, or token services.

Identity Server is based on the OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 standards, which are widely used and supported by many platforms and libraries. OpenID Connect is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that adds an identity layer on top of the authorization layer. It allows you to obtain information about the authenticated user (called claims) along with the access token. OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that enables clients to obtain limited access to resources on behalf of a user or a service.

## How does Identity Server work?

Identity Server acts as an identity provider (IdP) that issues tokens to clients that request them. A client can be any application that needs to access a protected resource, such as a web app, a mobile app, an API, or a microservice. A protected resource can be any data or functionality that requires authorization, such as a web API, a database, or a file system.

The basic flow of Identity Server is as follows:

1.  The client redirects the user to Identity Server's authorization endpoint with some parameters, such as the client ID, the redirect URI, the response type, the scope, and the state.
2.  Identity Server authenticates the user using one of the configured authentication methods, such as username and password, social login, or external IdP.
3.  Identity Server asks the user for consent if required by the client or the scope. The user can review and approve the requested permissions and claims.
4.  Identity Server redirects the user back to the client's redirect URI with an authorization code or an access token, depending on the response type.
5.  The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token and an optional refresh token at Identity Server's token endpoint using its client secret or client assertion.
6.  The client uses the access token to access the protected resource by sending it in the authorization header of the HTTP request.
7.  The protected resource validates the access token using one of the methods supported by Identity Server, such as introspection endpoint, reference tokens, or JWT tokens.
8.  The protected resource returns the requested data or functionality to the client if the access token is valid and has the required scope and claims.

## How can you use Identity Server?

To use Identity Server in your projects, you need to do the following steps:

-   Install Identity Server as a NuGet package in your .NET Core project.
-   Configure Identity Server options in your appsettings.json file or in code. You need to specify things like signing credentials, data protection keys, endpoints, clients, resources, scopes, claims, etc.
-   Implement your own user store and profile service if you want to use your own database or identity management system for storing and retrieving user information. You can also use ASP.NET Core Identity or other existing libraries for this purpose.
-   Implement your own consent service if you want to customize the consent screen or logic for your users. You can also use Identity Server's default consent service or UI library for this purpose.
-   Register Identity Server middleware in your Startup.cs file to enable Identity Server endpoints and services in your application pipeline.
-   Protect your web applications and APIs using one of the authentication and authorization schemes supported by Identity Server, such as cookie authentication, JWT bearer authentication, OpenID Connect authentication handler, etc.

Conclusion

In this blog post, I have given you an overview of what Identity Server is, how it works, and how you can use it to secure your web applications and APIs. Identity Server is a powerful and flexible framework that allows you to implement various authentication and authorization scenarios using standard protocols and formats. I hope you have found this post useful and informative.
